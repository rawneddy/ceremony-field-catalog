# Custom instructions
custom_instructions: |
  - You have broad permissions but ALWAYS ask before:
    * Deleting git branches
    * Running destructive commands outside the project directory
    * Using sudo or privilege escalation
    * Modifying system configuration
  - When in doubt about safety, ask first
  - Confirm before running any command that could affect production systems
